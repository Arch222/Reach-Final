// When you use ./reach run, you are creating two Docker containers --- 
// one that runs the Algorand or Ethereum devnet and the other that runs your application --- 
// they are connected together, so your application can reach the network

// Both are Dockerized, so you don't need to worry about getting your installation perfect
// But, you don't need to do it that way, you can always just install node and npm locally to run your program and use an network you want
